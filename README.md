# Exchange Rate Forecasting Using Ensemble ANN Model


Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is one of the methods which has been widely used in forecasting the financial market.  In this project, an ensemble ANN model is proposed to forecast the currency exchange rate between Malaysian Ringgit and other currencies such as USD, EURO,and SGD. The ensemble ANN models are constructed with homogeneous neural networks such as Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) using different algorithms and also with heterogeneous neural networks such as MLPs, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),  and Radial Basis  Function network (RBF).

The optimal structure for each neural network will be found by modifying the different parameters such as number of input nodes, number of hidden nodes, activation functions for the hidden and output layers, training algorithms, error functions etc. The optimal structures found will be used in ensemble models. 

The accuracy of the results from the ensemble ANN models will be compared with the individual optimal ANN models. The datasets which required to train, validate and test the network will be gathered from Bank Negara Malaysia website.
