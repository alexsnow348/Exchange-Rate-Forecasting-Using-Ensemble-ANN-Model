# Exchange Rate Forecasting Using Ensemble ANN Model

The forecasting is mainly done by using three different ANN network models namely:

* Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Radial Basic Function (RBF)
 
The performance of the forecasting measures with **MAE and RMSE**.
